//Description: This class handles all the manipulations to the Link Lists. It can
//             create, delete, modify, and show the amount and current elements.
//             This class also implements Cloneable to allow for cloning of objects
//             of this class. This class also includes a list copy method that will
//             produce a copy of the individual nodes to fully produce a replica
//             of the origional object that will allow the user to modify it without
//             affecting the origional.
